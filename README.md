# Demo of Service/Client API Design
This project combines gRPC, FastAPI, and React.

## fastAPI with React
- Debugging using Postman through VS Code.
- FastAPI to define endpoints under 'inventory' directory
- redis cloud database (app.redislabs.com) hosted on Google Cloud Platform

## gRPC server - client in python
    Mostly following the Quickstart from https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/.
